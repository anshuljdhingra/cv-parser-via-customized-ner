WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux","annotation":[{"label":["Others"],"points":[{"start":7839,"end":8485,"text":"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux"}]},{"label":["Years"],"points":[{"start":7829,"end":7835,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7820,"end":7826,"text":"Testing"}]},{"label":["Years"],"points":[{"start":7810,"end":7816,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7805,"end":7807,"text":"TCL"}]},{"label":["Years"],"points":[{"start":7795,"end":7801,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7787,"end":7792,"text":"router"}]},{"label":["Years"],"points":[{"start":7777,"end":7783,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7769,"end":7774,"text":"Python"}]},{"label":["Years"],"points":[{"start":7759,"end":7765,"text":"2 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7745,"end":7756,"text":"optimization"}]},{"label":["TimePeriod"],"points":[{"start":7681,"end":7684,"text":"2011"}]},{"label":["College"],"points":[{"start":7664,"end":7678,"text":"ANNA University"}]},{"label":["Degree"],"points":[{"start":7652,"end":7661,"text":"B.E in CSE"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":6883,"end":6888,"text":"router"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":6858,"end":6869,"text":"optimization"}]},{"label":["Company"],"points":[{"start":6598,"end":6610,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":6493,"end":6498,"text":"Python"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":6476,"end":6478,"text":"TCL"}]},{"label":["TimePeriod"],"points":[{"start":5654,"end":5679,"text":"June 2011 to December 2012"}]},{"label":["Title"],"points":[{"start":5609,"end":5648,"text":"Software Engineer -
